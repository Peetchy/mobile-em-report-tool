# Thai Language Support Added to WCAG-EM Report Tool

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully added Thai language support to the WCAG-EM Report Tool. Here's what was implemented:

### 1. Language Configuration
- Added Thai language to `/src/locales/index.json` with:
  ```json
  {
    "lang": "th",
    "title": "ไทย",
    "status": "draft"
  }
  ```

### 2. Translation Structure
Created complete Thai translation files in `/src/locales/th/` with the following structure:

#### UI Components (`/src/locales/th/UI/`)
- `COMMON.json` - Common UI elements, buttons, labels
- `EARL.json` - Evaluation result terminology
- `IMPORT.json` - Import functionality messages
- `NAV.json` - Navigation elements
- `REPORT.json` - Report-related labels

#### Page Content (`/src/locales/th/PAGES/`)
- `AUDIT.json` - Step 4: Audit Sample page
- `EXPLORE.json` - Step 2: Explore Website page  
- `REPORT.json` - Report viewing page
- `SAMPLE.json` - Step 3: Select Sample page
- `SCOPE.json` - Step 1: Define Scope page
- `START.json` - Overview/Start page
- `SUMMARY.json` - Step 5: Report Findings page

#### WCAG Content (`/src/locales/th/WCAG.json`)
- Translated WCAG principles, guidelines, and success criteria
- Includes proper Thai translations for accessibility terminology

### 3. Build System Updates
- Modified `/src/scripts/i18n.js` to register the Thai locale
- Added line: `register('th', () => import('../locales/translations_th.json'));`

### 4. Translation Features
- Comprehensive Thai translations for all user interface elements
- Accessibility terminology properly translated
- Maintains the draft status indicating it's a volunteer translation
- Includes appropriate warnings about unofficial translation status

### 5. Build Output
The build system now generates:
- `translations_th-[hash].js` - Thai translation bundle
- Properly integrated with the language selector
- Ready for use in the application

## Files Modified
1. `/src/locales/index.json` - Added Thai language entry
2. `/src/scripts/i18n.js` - Registered Thai locale import
3. Created `/src/locales/th/` directory with complete translation files

## Translation Quality
- All translations are contextually appropriate for accessibility evaluation
- Technical WCAG terminology properly translated to Thai
- User interface elements maintain consistent terminology
- Includes proper status indicators for draft translations

## Testing
The Thai language option now appears in the language selector and the application can be fully used in Thai. The build system properly generates the Thai language bundle and integrates it with the existing internationalization framework.

## Usage
Users can now select "ไทย" (Thai) from the language selector to use the WCAG-EM Report Tool in Thai language.
